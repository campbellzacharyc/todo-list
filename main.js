// 1. Your ‘todos’ are going to be objects that you’ll want to dynamically create, which means either using factories or constructors/classes to generate them.

// 2. Brainstorm what kind of properties your todo-items are going to have. At a minimum they should have a title, description, dueDate and priority. 
//     You might also want to include notes or even a checklist.

// 3. Your todo list should have projects or separate lists of todos. When a user first opens the app, there should be some sort of ‘default’ project to 
//     which all of their todos are put. Users should be able to create new projects and choose which project their todos go into.
